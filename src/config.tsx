			<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</p><br />
			<p>
			I'm <span className="highlighted">Ismail Aarab</span>, a Master's student at <span className="highlighted">MILA (Quebec AI Institute)</span> and a
			<span className="highlighted"> graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Polytechnique MontrÃ©al</span>. 
			Iâ€™m passionate about building high-performance software and innovative solutions at the intersection of quantitative finance, data, and AI.
			</p><br />
			<p>
			I recently returned from an exchange at Korea University where I had the opportunity to deepen my expertise in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.  
			Through multiple internshipsâ€”including two at Morgan Stanleyâ€”Iâ€™ve gained real-world experience in DevOps, backend systems, and machine learning.
			</p><br />
			<p>
			My personal projects reflect this blend of interests: from a C++ order book simulator implementing advanced matching algorithms to full-stack web applications and AI tools.
			I thrive on writing clean, efficient code and solving challenging problems.
